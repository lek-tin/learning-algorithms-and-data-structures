Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to [the definition of LCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor) on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

Given binary search tree:  root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5]
```
        _______6______
       /              \
    ___2__          ___8__
   /      \        /      \
   0      _4       7       9
         /  \
         3   5
```
**Example 1:**
```
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself 
             according to the LCA definition.
```
**Note:**
- All of the nodes' values will be unique.
- p and q are different and both values will exist in the BST.
**Solution:**
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution(object):
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root, p, q):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :type p: TreeNode
        :type q: TreeNode
        :rtype: TreeNode
        """
        # Edge/Condition
        if not root:
            return None
        if root == p or root == q:
            return root
        
        # Divide
        left = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
        right = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)
        
        # Conquer
        if left and right:
            return root
        if not left:
            return right
        if not right:
            return left
```
