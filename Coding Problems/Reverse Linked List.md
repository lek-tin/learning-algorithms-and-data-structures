Reverse a singly linked list.

**Example:**
```
Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL
Output: 5->4->3->2->1->NULL
```
**Follow up:**

A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?

**Solution:**
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution(object):
    def reverseList(self, head):
        prev = None
        curr = head
        while (curr != None):
            nextTemp = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = nextTemp
        return prev
```
