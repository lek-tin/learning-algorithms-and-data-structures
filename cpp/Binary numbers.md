A two's complement is a very efficient way of storing negatives, as it follows all the rules that a negative of a number should have:

1. Taking negative of a number twice gives the original, similarly, if you take 2's complement twice, you get the original number
2. A number added to its negative gives zero. The same is true for two's complement
+0 and -0 are equal.
